# Signalling Game
Signalling game's Nash Equilibrium implemented with python

To use, just import Equilibrium.py and use "Eq" function:

The function gets theta, transmit utility and receive utility and returns a list of all nash equilibriums.

Pay attention to how to fill utility arrays (It is One-based indexed).

In jupyter notebook you will see a user interface which finds the maximum of all equilibriums(based on sender's expected utility) and plots it
