# Signaling Game
Signaling game's Nash Equilibrium implemented with python.

To use, import Equilibrium.py and use the "Eq" function:

The function gets theta, transmit utility and receive utility, and returns a list of all equilibrium.

Please pay attention to how to fill utility arrays (It is One-based indexed).

In jupyter notebook, you will see a user interface that finds the maximum of all equilibriums(based on the transmitter's expected utility) and plots it.
